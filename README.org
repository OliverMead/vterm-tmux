+ `vterm-tmux-default-session' The default name for a tmux session
+ `vterm-tmux-default-hostname' The default (host)name for local
  connections

  the session
+ `vterm-tmux-env' A list of environment variables to explicitly pass
  to the shell
+ `vterm-tmux-buffer-name-format' Function of HOSTNAME and SESSION to
